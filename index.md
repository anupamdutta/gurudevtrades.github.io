# GammaGrid Insights

> Market structure is not random.

## What I actually study

I don’t predict direction.  
I track **pressure, positioning, and volatility expansion**.

- Implied Volatility behavior  
- Dealer Gamma positioning  
- Liquidity-driven moves  
- Structural inefficiencies  

---

## Framework

This is not discretionary noise.

This is a structured approach:

- Observe volatility regime  
- Map gamma exposure  
- Identify forced flows  
- Execute only when asymmetry exists  

---

## Core Areas

### ⟶ IV Analysis
Understanding expansion, compression, and mispricing.

### ⟶ Gamma Structure
Where dealers are forced to hedge. Where markets get pinned or pushed.

### ⟶ Trade Logs
Actual executions. No hindsight. No storytelling.

## Operating Principle

Trade less.  
Observe more.  
Execute only when structure aligns.
