# MMR TERMINAL

> Market Maker Risk Engine  
> Volatility Surface Normalization

---

## Overview

MMR Terminal is a deterministic option pricing engine designed to map discrete market risk into a consistent implied volatility regime.

This is not a standard Black-Scholes wrapper.

It is built on a proprietary framework:

**NCP40 / RSEDAO**

The system reconstructs volatility structure under real market constraints, preserving forward consistency and surface alignment.

---

## What it does

- Estimates **risk-adjusted option prices** (European style)  
- Internally derives **Implied Volatility structure**  
- Normalizes volatility surface under market constraints  
- Detects mispricing and structural inefficiencies  

---

## Key Idea

Market prices are not always consistent.

MMR Terminal forces consistency.

It adjusts:

- Call-Put parity deviations  
- Strike-based distortions  
- Funding-driven dislocations  

to produce a structurally valid volatility surface.
